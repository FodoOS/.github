# FodoOS

FodoOS "organization" is a series of projects under the same idea, related together and made from different languages mostly the C programming language and Assembly.
- Starting as a 32-bit Kernel fully functional with standard library and a simple graphics using VGA interface.
- A second linked program would be a C language compiler.

## Objectives
The purpose of this projects is to benefit the community and people interested in:
  - low-level programming.
  - creating low-level software applications like Kernels, Compilers and Assemblers.
  - learning new skiils by hands on real-life projects.
    - This projects' purposes is to help understand the inner working and fundamentals of day-to-day software.

 ## Planned Projects
 - FodoOS: a 32-bit Kernel with some sample programs and simple graphics.
 - FodoCompiler: a 32-bit C compiler compatible with the FodoOS or can be used seperatly.
 
 There will be future projects planned. Any help or new ideas is welcome.
